    "text": "Lifespan varies widely among individuals and can be influenced by many factors, including demographic characteristics. This study uses data from over 3,500 U.S. gubernatorial election candidates collected by the primer.data package to explore how long candidates live after their elections. A potential weakness of our model is that unmeasured factors, such as lifestyle or health conditions, may bias the estimated relationship between running for office and longevity. We model candidate longevity, measured in years lived after an election, as a linear function of their age at election and other covariates. One key finding is that for male candidates, each additional year of age at election is associated with living about 0.8 years less after the election compared to females, with a 95% confidence interval from about –1.5 to –0.07 years.\n\\[\nY = \\beta_0 + \\beta_1 X_1 + \\beta_2 X_2 + \\cdots + \\beta_n X_n + \\epsilon\n\\] with \\[\n\\epsilon \\sim \\mathcal{N}(0, \\sigma^2)\n\\]\n\\[\n\\widehat{\\text{att\\_end}} = 8.45 + 1.55 \\cdot \\text{treatment}_{\\text{Treated}}\n\\]\n\n\nCall:\nmultinom(formula = pres_vote ~ sex, data = example_data, trace = FALSE)\n\nCoefficients:\n        (Intercept)   sexMale\nClinton  -0.6974369  9.142506\nPerot    -9.1277013 17.572839\n\nStd.
